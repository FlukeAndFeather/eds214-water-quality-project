# Automate

## Running the entire analysis requires rendering one Quarto document

Meets spec- I condensed my spaghetti code into a running analysis in one quarto doc, which also includes my data wrangling and visualization

## The analysis runs without errors

Meets spec- I was able to run a rolling mean function without an errors. All of my supporting code runs with no errors as well

## The analysis produces the expected output

Meets spec- I was able to produce a graph similar to the original
Exceeds: I plan to continue with data visualization to make it prettier 

## Data import/cleaning is handled in its own script(s)

Not yet- Need to reorganize the code into a cleaning script from spaghetti

# Organize

## Raw data is contained in its own folder

Meets spec- data is in its own folder

## Intermediate outputs are created and saved to a separate folder from raw data

Not yet- intermediate outputs are not saved anywhere

## At least one piece of functionality has been refactored into a function in its own file

Not yet- I have not refactored data into a function in its own file

# Document

## The repo has a README that explains where to find (1) data, (2) analysis script, (3) supporting code, and (4) outputs

Not yet- README is not complete

## The README includes a flowchart and text explaining how the analysis works

Not yet- README is not complete

## The code is appropriately commented

Meets spec- Each step is explained through the process

## Variable and function names are descriptive and follow a consistent naming convention

Meets spec- variables are consistently named and descriptive

# Scale- After cloning the repo on Workbench:

## Running the environment initialization script installs all required packages
Not yet- need to make this

## The analysis script runs without errors
Not yet- need to test
